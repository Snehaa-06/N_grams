# 📊 N-Grams Analysis with Python

This project demonstrates how to work with **N-Grams** in Natural Language Processing (NLP). It covers the concept of unigrams, bigrams, trigrams, and higher-order n-grams using Python and visualization techniques.

## 📁 Repository Contents

- `N-Grams.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing:
  - Tokenization of text
  - Generation of N-Grams (unigram, bigram, trigram)
  - Frequency analysis
  - Visualizations (e.g., bar plots, word clouds)

## 📌 Key Concepts

- **N-Grams**: Contiguous sequences of `n` items from a given sample of text or speech.
- **Applications**: Used in text prediction, language modeling, and more.
- **Text Processing**: Includes steps like lowercasing, removing stopwords, and punctuation.
